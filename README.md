### FizzBuzz Implementation in Python
This project is a Python-based implementation of the classic "FizzBuzz" problem, commonly used in programming exercises and interviews. The program takes a single integer input `n` and prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` with the following rules:
- Print "Fizz" for numbers divisible by 3.
- Print "Buzz" for numbers divisible by 5.
- Print "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.
- Print the number itself if none of the above conditions are met.

### Features
1. **Input Validation**: Ensures the input is an integer within the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000).
2. **Error Handling**: Handles invalid input types and missing input gracefully.
3. **Efficiency**: Optimized to handle large inputs up to 200,000 efficiently.

### Main Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate conditional logic, loops, and input validation in Python. It serves as a beginner-friendly exercise for learning basic programming concepts while ensuring clean and efficient code.

### Future Implementation Ideas
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.
- Extend the logic to accept custom divisors and words (e.g., replace 3 with 7 and "Fizz" with "Boom").
- Allow output to be written to a file for large sequences.
